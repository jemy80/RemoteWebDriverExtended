# RemoteWebDriverExtended

A Selenium RemoteWebDriver extension to reconnect to existing sessions for IE32, Chrome and Firefox. 
Copied the code for the HttpW3CWireProtocolCommandExecutor (needed for the Firefox driver) from https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/dotnet/src/webdriver/Remote/HttpCommandExecutor.cs I am sure there is a better way to do it.
